      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>What Up?!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>On paper I was born in La Mesa, California, but my home is Bonney Lake in Washington State. I have lived here 41 out of the 42 years of my life.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Learning! I'm always trying to learn. Lately I have been splitting my time between school, and working on my MINI Cooper. I LOVE MINI Coopers! Other interests include exercise (specifically outdoor running or indoor recumbent bike). And of course being in the great outdoors of Washington State.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>This is a difficult question for me to answer. Is money a factor in my dream job? Of course, but only to the extent that I can make a living wage and provide for my future family. What's more important is that I feel like I am both mentally stimulated, and I feel like I am making a genuinly important contribution to my local communities and beyond.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>As I mentioned I have lived in Washington State for the vast majority of my life. I love it here, but lately I have opened myself to the possibility of new adventures elsewhere.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was born for this. I recently left my last job. I loved it there, and I loved my co-workers, but I was horribly understimulated. Software Engineering and Development has everything I need. A diverse skillset that opens doors. A platform from which to make my contribution to society, and lastly the opportunity to always be learning. If you remember correctly that is the thing I love most!</p>
